    <h1 class='aboutMe'>Personal Biography</h1>
    <p class="aboutMe">My grandfather was one of the very first computer programmers on the original IBM mainframes, and got my father a job when I was around 5 years old to begin a career of his own in computer programming rather than warehouse work. At around 8 years old I picked up some of the training books my father had for VisualBasic and with some occasional help started to read through it. At around age 15 I finally finished slowly going through that book front to back and then started trying to learn JavaScript as well, and then around 8 months ago I started trying to add Python3 to my knowledge base. Everything I've learned has been informal personal learning and I look forward to learning a more polished corporate style of programming as well as things like HTML and CSS I never really took time to learn along the way.</p>

    <h1 class='goals'>Goals</h1>
    <p class='goals'>My long term goal is to open my own small Indie game design studio. For the short term I want to find work developing code in any capacity for the next few years and follow that by progressing into a product management capacity to build out the necessary developmental skills I will need in my own business after.</p>
